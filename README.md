# Stylecraze

I build this website during our construct week of Unit-3 and Unit-4. We build the frontend side of this website using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. After that we implemented signup and login functionality via authentication and authorization. We build this website with responsiveness with media queries.

You can run this on your local system by Live Share.
